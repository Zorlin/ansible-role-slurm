Ansible Role: Slurm
===================

NOT READY FOR CONSUMPTION YET

This role will automatically install and configure a Slurm cluster and workers.

It currently will only support Ubuntu 20.04.

New release versions of this role will be released when ready, using Semantic Versioning to keep things predictable.

I will not be changing or deleting release tags once published, so you can pin and rely on them safely.

If a critical fix is needed a new tag will be created :)

You should not rely solely on this stuff especially in production until I start publishing the 1.x.x series at least.

However, I will keep it as stable and production ready as possible.
